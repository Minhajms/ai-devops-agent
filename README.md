# AI-Powered DevOps Pipeline

This project is an AI-powered agent that acts as a self-healing guardian for your CI/CD pipeline. It proactively identifies issues, predicts failures, and automatically fixes or mitigates them before they impact the pipeline.

## Features

- **Predictive Failure Analysis**: Use machine learning to analyze historical pipeline data and predict potential failures.
- **Self-Healing Automation**: Automatically fix common issues or roll back problematic changes.
- **Real-Time Feedback**: Provide real-time suggestions to developers during code commits or pull requests.
- **Pipeline Optimization**: Suggest optimizations for faster builds and deployments.
- **ChatOps Integration**: Allow developers and DevOps engineers to interact with the agent via Slack, Microsoft Teams, or Discord.

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Minhajms/ai-devops-agent.git
